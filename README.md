# ultimate-tic-tac-toe

Hi! This is my implementation of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, which is a game that has 9 tic-tac-toe boards set up on a big tic-tac-toe board. I learned about this game 

# Running the Game 

You will need the Java JDK to run this program. 

Run: javac TicTacToeRunner.java
After success, run: java TicTacToeRunner

The game will start and a window will pop up with a lobby where you can select 1 or 2 players. 

Hava fun!
